## Refactoring

> ## Refactoring
> > Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve source-code maintainability and create a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.

While most IDEs and code editors provide some support for automated refactoring, this tends not to work so well with dynamically typed languages like Python.
When refactoring a statically typed language, it is easy for the IDE to recognise that one use of a variable, function or class is the same as another, since any use of the same identifier across multiple files must have been explicitly identified (by e.g. including the header files).
Dynamic languages, like Python, do not have this requirement, so it is much more difficult to check that an identifier refers to the same object.

The process of refactoring has a basis in the Structured Programming paradigm.
Since we are aiming to improve the structure of our code without changing the behaviour, it is useful to think of our code as a hierarchy of structured blocks.
Within each structured block, we think about the control flow - the order in which statements are executed.
If the control flow is guaranteed to enter at the top of the block, and leave at the bottom of the block, then we can treat that block as a single entity and rearrange it without needing to worry so much about its interactions with the rest of the code.

For a visual representation of this, see [this section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFv8Wm2HdNM&t=2683) of Kevlin Henney's talk on Structured Programming.
In this section he demonstrates how a rearrangement of the structure of the code results in a block form, where much of the detail can be ignored and we have greater freedom to perform refactoring.
Don't worry if you don't understand the code sample he's using, that's much less important than the structure itself.

When we're refactoring existing code we're aiming to improve the readability of our code.
Often what we're doing is breaking up functions or classes which are too complex, so a good rule of thumb is that a function shouldn't be longer than 30 lines.
Some people take a much stricter view and suggest a limit of 10 lines.
The exact length isn't particularly important, but the idea is that each function should be responsible for only one task.
If a function feels too long, it's often because it's trying to do multiple tasks.

## Modules

So far we've been structuring our code within a single file, but what happens when this file gets too long to manage easily?

As we've seen with NumPy and a few other bits from the Python standard library, in Python we're able to separate out code into a **library** and **import** it into the main part of our program.
Some equivalent of this is possible in most programming languages (e.g. `#include` in C++ after the linker has run).

Once again, we'll use the temperature conversion code to illustrate this:

~~~ python
# file: conversions.py

def fahr_to_celsius(fahr):
    """Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.

    Uses standard Fahrenheit to Celsius formula.

    :param fahr: float temperature in Fahrenheit
    :returns: float temperature in Celsius
    """
    celsius = (fahr - 32) * (5/9)
    return celsius

def fahr_to_kelvin(fahr):
    """Convert Fahrenheight to Kelvin.

    Uses standard Fahrenheit to Kelvin formula, making use of fahr_to_celsius function.

    :param fahr: float temperature in Fahrenheit
    :returns: float temperature in Kelvin
    """
    kelvin = fahr_to_celsius(fahr) + 273.15
    return kelvin
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~ python
# file: climate_analysis.py

import conversions

print(conversions.fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print(conversions.fahr_to_kelvin(32), 'K')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0 C
273.15 K
~~~
{: .output}

## Packages

As well as modules, we also have **packages** as a way of structuring our Python files.
A Python package is really just a directory with a set of modules in it, but with a special Python file `__init__.py`
This special file usually doesn't need to contain anything, but if it exists within a directory, Python will treat that directory as a package of modules.

To put our temperature conversion code in a package:

~~~ bash
mkdir conversions
mv conversions.py conversions/temperature.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~ python
# file: climate_analysis.py

from conversions import temperature

print(temperature.fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print(temperature.fahr_to_kelvin(32), 'K')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0 C
273.15 K
~~~
{: .output}

If we wish to, we can shorten this a little bit by adding to our package's `__init__.py`:

~~~ python
# file: __init__.py

from .temperature import fahr_to_celsius, fahr_to_kelvin
~~~
{: .language-python}

The dot in `.temperature` means, "the module `temperature` in this package".
Without the dot, Python will look for a `temperature` module outside of the current package, and fail to find it.

So now we can use these functions directly from the package:

~~~ python
# file: climate_analysis.py

import conversions

print(conversions.fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print(conversions.fahr_to_kelvin(32), 'K')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0 C
273.15 K
~~~
{: .output}

## Type Annotations

One of the main things we use to describe the differences between programming languages is the **type system** that they use.
The type system is how the language represents and manages different kinds (or types) of data.
Types may be primitive types built in to the language such as `int` or `float`, up to complex custom types such as the classes that we define ourselves.

When talking about type systems in different programming languages, there are two distinctions to be made.
The first is whether the language is **statically typed** or **dynamically typed**.
In statically typed languages, each variable must have a type, usually set when it is defined - C++ is a statically typed language:

~~~ c++
int count = 0;
const double x = 10.;
~~~
{: .source}

In contrast, a dynamically typed language like Python, does not need / allow variables to have a type defined as the variable may hold multiple values of multiple different types over its lifetime.

~~~ python
count = 0
x = 10.

count = 'Hello World!'
x = print
~~~
{: .language-python}

Strictly speaking, variables in Python do not *hold* a value, they are **bound** to a value, which is why we can rebind it to refer to an object of a different type.

The second axis is whether the language is **strongly typed** or **weakly typed**.
Strongly typed languages do not allow the type of a value (not the variable, but the value it holds) to be converted without an explicit cast, whereas weakly typed languages do.

In addition to this, the type system in Python is often referred to as **duck typing**, after the duck test "if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck".
This means that the type of an object in most cases does not actually matter, but rather the important thing is that the object has the attributes and behaviours that are required of it.

Type annotations are a slightly devisive topic within the Python community, with some people claiming they increase the clarity of code, while others claim that they undermine one of the main benefits of Python's dynamic typing.
Both of these viewpoints are to some degree true, so before using type annotations it is important to consider whether they are a net benefit to your code.

Type annotations make Python functions (and classes, etc.) look a little more like C++ code.
Function parameters are annotated with a colon followed by the type, while return values are annotated with an arrow then the type after the function parentheses.
We can also add type annotations to ReST docstrings.

~~~ python
def fahr_to_celsius(fahr: float) -> float:
    """Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.

    Uses standard Fahrenheit to Celsius formula.

    :param float fahr: temperature in Fahrenheit
    :returns: temperature in Celsius
    :rtype: float
    """
    celsius = (fahr - 32) * (5/9)
    return celsius

def fahr_to_kelvin(fahr: float) -> float:
    """Convert Fahrenheight to Kelvin.

    Uses standard Fahrenheit to Kelvin formula, making use of fahr_to_celsius function.

    :param float fahr: temperature in Fahrenheit
    :returns: temperature in Kelvin
    :rtype: float
    """
    kelvin = fahr_to_celsius(fahr) + 273.15
    return kelvin
~~~
{: .language-python}

One of the advantages of an intelligent editor like VSCode is support for things like type annotations.
If you try to use an annotated function with arguments of a different type, we should see a highlighted complaint.

To see how type annotations actually behave in practice, lets write another, very simple, function:

~~~ python
def add_floats(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a + b

print(add_floats(1, 2))
print(add_floats('Hello', 'World!'))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
3
HelloWorld!
~~~
{: .output}

As we can see, although our editor might tell us that we're using the function incorrectly when we call it with two strings instead of floats, the function does actually work.
This is because type annotations in Python aren't quite like they are in a statically typed language.
The type annotations we provide are just suggestions and are not used to perform checking at runtime, but are an indicator that tools can use to inform us of potential errors.

If we want to use these type annotations as part of our testing, we can use a tool such as the [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) static type checker.

## Configuration Files

Remember back when we were looking at the procedural paradigm, before we knew about classes, and we used a nested data structure to represent our academics?

~~~ python
academics = [
    {
        'name': 'Alice',
        'papers': [
            {
                'title': 'My science paper',
            },
            {
                'title': 'My other science paper',
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        'name': 'Bob',
        'papers': [
            {
                'title': 'Bob writes about science',
            }
        ]
    }
]
~~~
{: .language-python}

Well, it just so happens that this data structure is almost exactly the same as a **JSON** file.
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a very common format for handling config files and other complex data structures, since it has libraries for processing it in almost all programming languages.

In Python the `json` module is part of the standard library, so we don't need to worry about installing anything extra.

Unfortunately we don't have time to cover this properly, but as usual, the Python documentation is a useful resource.
See [JSON library](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/json.html).

> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> If you're not familiar with C++ feel free to skip this one.

> Before you make any changes to the code, make sure you run it and make a note of the output - when refactoring it's important that you don't change the behaviour of the code.
> Later in the course we'll cover proper software testing, so we can automate these checks, but for now we'll have to check manually.
> Though this code relies on random numbers, we've set a fixed random seed so that the behaviour is predictable to make testing easier.
