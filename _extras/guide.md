## Q&A Sessions

See [here](https://github.com/SABS-R3/software-engineering-day1/blob/gh-pages/_extras/guide-common-qa.md) for a set of suggested common points and questions to raise during a Q&A session. In addition to these, see below for points specific to particular Q&A sessions.

### Day 3: Morning Q&A Session

- Quick summary of what's coming next
    - Note that there's a group exercise in the first episode that will ask the group to nominate a reporter to report back for only a couple of minutes at the afternoon Q&A session

### Day 3: Afternoon Q&A Session

- Morning group exercise feedback
    - Each group has two minutes for its reporter to highlight the two biggest issues they found
    - Ask each group to focus on a very brief description of each issue and how each could be improved
    - After all groups finished, highlight common themes uncovered by the groups, and the value of getting colleagues to review your code, particularly before it is used officially by others 
    - Mention risk of expert awareness gap - where you know your software so well it becomes difficult to gauge what others may find difficult
- Quick summary of what's coming next
  - Note that there's a group exercise in the next episode that will ask the group to nominate a reporter to report back for only a couple of minutes at the morning Q&A session on Day 4
